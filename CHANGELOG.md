# Changelog

All notable changes to RustChan will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.13] — 2026-03-08

### ✨ Added
- **ChanClassic theme** — a new theme that mimics the classic 4chan aesthetic: light tan/beige background, maroon/red accents, blue post-number links, and the iconic post block styling. Available in the theme picker alongside existing themes.
- **Default theme in settings.toml** — the generated `settings.toml` now includes a `default_theme` field so the server-side default theme can be set before first startup, without requiring admin panel access.
- **Home page subtitle in settings.toml** — `site_subtitle` is now present in the generated `settings.toml` directly below `forum_name`, allowing the home page subtitle to be configured at install time.
- **Default theme selector in admin panel** — the Site Settings section now includes a dropdown to set the site-wide default theme served to new visitors.

### 🔄 Changed
- **Admin panel reorganized** — sections are now ordered: Site Settings → Boards → Moderation Log → Report Inbox → Moderation (ban appeals, active bans, word filters consolidated) → Full Site Backup & Restore → Board Backup & Restore → Database Maintenance → Active Onion Address. Code order matches page order for easier future editing.
- **"Backup & Restore" renamed** to **"Full Site Backup & Restore"** to clearly distinguish it from the board-level backup section.
- **Ban appeals, active bans, and word filters** condensed into a single **Moderation** panel with clearly labelled subsections.

## [1.0.12] — 2026-03-07

### 🔄 Changed
- **Database module fixes** — `threads.rs`: added explicit `ROLLBACK` on failed `COMMIT` to prevent dirty transaction state. `mod.rs`: added `sort_unstable` + `dedup` to `paths_safe_to_delete` to eliminate duplicate path entries. `mod.rs`: added `media_type` and `edited_at` columns to the base `CREATE TABLE posts` schema to match the final migrated state. `admin.rs`: replaced inlined Post row mapper with shared `super::posts::map_post` to eliminate duplication. `admin.rs`: clarified `run_wal_checkpoint` doc comment on return tuple order.
- **Template module fixes** — `board.rs`: fixed archive thumbnail path prefix from `/static/` to `/boards/`. `board.rs`: moved `fmt_ts` to the top-level import, removed redundant local `use` inside `archive_page`. `thread.rs`: corrected misleading comment about embed and draft script loading. `thread.rs`: added doc comment documenting the `body_html` trust precondition on `render_post`. `forms.rs`: removed dead `captcha_js` variable and no-op string concatenation.
- **CSS cleanup** — removed 11 dead rules for classes never emitted by templates or JS (`.greentext`, `.quote-link`, `.admin-thread-del-btn`, duplicate `.media-expanded`, `.media-rotate-btn`, `.thread-id-badge`, `.quote-block`, `.quote-toggle`, `.archive-heading`, `.autoupdate-bar`, `.video-player`). Fixed two undefined CSS variable references (`--font-mono` → `--font`, `--bg-body` → `--bg`). Merged duplicate `.file-container` block into a single declaration.
- **Database module split** — the 2,264-line monolithic `db.rs` has been reorganized into five focused modules with zero call-site changes (all existing `db::` references compile unchanged):
  - `mod.rs` (466 lines) — connection pool, shared types (`NewPost`, `CachedFile`), schema initialization, shared helpers
  - `boards.rs` (293 lines) — site settings, board CRUD, stats
  - `threads.rs` (333 lines) — thread listing, creation, mutation, archiving, pruning
  - `posts.rs` (642 lines) — post CRUD, file deduplication, polls, job queue, worker helpers
  - `admin.rs` (558 lines) — admin sessions, bans, word filters, reports, mod log, ban appeals, IP history, maintenance
- **Template module split** — the 2,736-line monolithic template file has been reorganized into five focused modules with no changes to the public API (all existing handler code works without modification):
  - `mod.rs` (392 lines) — shared infrastructure: site name/subtitle statics, base layout, pagination, timestamp formatting, utility helpers
  - `board.rs` (697 lines) — home page, board index, catalog, search, and archive rendering
  - `thread.rs` (738 lines) — thread view, post rendering, polls, and post edit form
  - `admin.rs` (760 lines) — login page, admin panel, mod log, VACUUM results, IP history
  - `forms.rs` (198 lines) — new thread and reply forms, shared across board and thread pages

### 🔒 Security Fixes

**Critical**
- **PoW bypass on replies** — proof-of-work verification was only enforced on new threads but not on replies. Replies now require a valid PoW nonce when the board has CAPTCHA enabled.
- **PoW nonce replay** — the same proof-of-work solution could be submitted repeatedly. Used nonces are now tracked in memory and rejected within their 5-minute validity window. Stale entries are automatically pruned.

**High**
- **Removed inline JavaScript** — all inline `<script>` blocks and `onclick`/`onchange`/`onsubmit` attributes have been extracted into external `.js` files. The Content Security Policy now uses `script-src 'self'` with no `unsafe-inline`, closing a major XSS surface.
- **Backup upload size cap** — the restore endpoints previously accepted uploads of unlimited size, risking out-of-memory crashes. Both full and board restore routes are now capped at 512 MiB.

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Post rate limiting simplified** — removed the global `check_post_rate_limit` function that was silently overriding per-board cooldown settings. A board with `post_cooldown_secs = 0` now correctly means zero cooldown. The per-board setting is the sole post rate control.
- **API endpoints excluded from GET rate limit** — hover-preview requests (`/api/post/*`) were being counted against the navigational rate limit, causing false throttling on threads with many quote links. All `/api/` routes are now excluded alongside `/static/`, `/boards/`, and `/admin/`. The GET limiter now only covers page loads that a scraper would target (board index, catalog, archive, threads, search, home).
- **Trailing slash 404s** — several routes returned 404 when accessed with or without a trailing slash (board index, catalog, archive, thread pages, post editing). Added middleware to normalize trailing slashes so all URL variations resolve correctly. Bookmarks and manually typed URLs now work as expected.

## [1.0.11] — 2026-03-06

### 🔒 Security Fixes

**Critical**
- Added security headers (CSP, HSTS, Permissions-Policy) to block XSS and enforce HTTPS
- Fixed IP detection behind reverse proxies — bans and rate limits now actually work with nginx
- Added rate limiting to all read-only pages (60 req/min) to prevent denial-of-service
- Added zip-bomb protection on backup restore (max 1 GB per entry, max 50,000 entries)
- IP addresses are now hashed everywhere — raw IPs never appear in logs or memory
- Admin login now locks out after 5 failed attempts with increasing delays
- CSRF token comparison is now timing-safe to prevent token guessing
- Poll inputs now have size limits (10 options max, 128 chars each, 256-char question)

**High**
- Admin session cookies now expire properly instead of lasting forever
- Database connections now time out after 5 seconds instead of hanging forever under load
- Small endpoints (login, vote, report) now reject oversized requests at 64 KB instead of buffering 50 MB
- Fixed a redirect trick on logout that could send users to malicious sites via backslash URLs
- Report and appeal handlers now correctly detect IPs behind proxies
- Background workers now retry with smarter backoff instead of all hammering the database at once
- Fixed a race condition where two identical file uploads at the same time could cause a server error

### ✨ New Features
- **Ban + Delete button** on every post in admin view — one click to ban the user and remove the post
- **Ban appeal system** — banned users can submit an appeal; admins can accept or dismiss from the panel
- **Proof-of-Work CAPTCHA** — optional per-board anti-spam for new threads, solved automatically in the browser (~100ms)
- **Video embeds** — YouTube, Invidious, and Streamable links show a thumbnail with a play button; click to load the video
- **Cross-board quote previews** — hovering `>>>/board/123` links now shows a floating preview popup
- **Floating "new replies" pill** — shows how many new posts arrived while you're reading; click to scroll down
- **Live thread metadata** — reply count, lock status, and sticky badges update in real time without refreshing
- **"(You)" badges** — your own posts are marked so you can easily spot replies to them
- **Spoiler text** — wrap text in `[spoiler]...[/spoiler]` to hide it until hover/click

- **Database vacuum button** — compact the database from the admin panel after bulk deletions
- **IP history** — admins can click any post to see all posts from that IP across all boards
