RustChan is a fully-featured imageboard engine compiled into a **single Rust binary**. Deploy it on a VPS, a Raspberry Pi, or a local machine — no containers, no runtime, no package manager required. All persistent data lives in a single directory alongside the binary, making migrations as simple as `cp -r`.

**[ffmpeg](#ffmpeg--video--audio-processing)** is supported as an optional enhancement for video transcoding and audio waveforms. **[Tor](#tor--onion-service)** onion service hosting is built in via [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti) — no system `tor` installation required. Both degrade gracefully when disabled.

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 📋 Boards & Posting
- Multiple boards with independent per-board configuration
- Threaded replies with globally unique post numbers
- **Thread polls** — OP-only, 2–10 options, live percentage bar results, one vote per IP; expired vote rows cleaned up automatically
- **Spoiler tags** — `[spoiler]text[/spoiler]` with click-to-reveal
- **Dice rolling** — `[dice NdM]` resolved server-side at post time (e.g. `[dice 2d6]` → `🎲 2d6 ▸ ⚄ ⚅ = 11`)
- **Emoji shortcodes** — 25 built-in (`:fire:` → 🔥, `:think:` → 🤔, `:based:` → 🗿)
- **Cross-board links** — `>>>/board/123` with floating hover previews
- `**bold**`, `__italic__`, greentext, inline quote-links
- **Sage** — reply without bumping the thread
- **Post editing** — edit within a configurable window using your deletion token
- **Draft autosave** — reply text persisted to `localStorage` every 3 seconds; survives refreshes and crashes
- Tripcodes and user-deletable posts via deletion tokens
- Per-board NSFW tagging, bump limits, and thread caps
- Board index, catalog grid, full-text search, and pagination
- Trailing slash normalization — all URL variants resolve correctly

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🖼️ Media
- **Images:** JPEG *(EXIF-stripped and orientation-corrected on upload)*, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, SVG
- **Video:** MP4, WebM — auto-transcoded to VP9+Opus WebM via ffmpeg; AV1 streams re-encoded to VP9
- **GIF → WebM** — animated GIFs are converted to WebM inline at upload time (VP9, no background job)
- **Audio:** MP3, OGG, FLAC, WAV, M4A, AAC (up to 150 MB default)
- **Image + audio combo posts** — attach both an image and an audio file simultaneously
- **Audio waveform thumbnails** — generated via ffmpeg's `showwavespic` filter for standalone audio uploads
- **Waveform cache eviction** — background task prunes oldest thumbnails when the cache exceeds `waveform_cache_max_mb` (default 200 MiB); originals never touched
- **Video embed unfurling** — per-board opt-in; YouTube, Invidious, and Streamable URLs render as thumbnail + click-to-play widgets
- Auto-generated **WebP thumbnails** with configurable dimensions; SVG placeholders used for video (without ffmpeg), audio, and SVG sources
- Resizable inline image expansion via drag-to-resize
- **Client-side auto-compression** — oversized files are compressed in-browser before upload with a live progress bar
- **Streaming multipart** — uploads are validated against size limits in flight; never fully buffered in RAM; per-field text caps prevent OOM from oversized form fields
- Two-layer file validation: Content-Type header + magic byte inspection (extensions are never trusted); BMP, TIFF, and SVG magic bytes supported

### 🛡️ Moderation & Administration
- Board creation, configuration, and deletion from the web panel
- Thread sticky and lock toggles
- **Per-post ban + delete** — single-click to ban an IP hash and remove the post simultaneously
- **Ban appeal system** — banned users can submit appeals; admins review from a dedicated queue with dismiss and accept+unban actions
- **IP history view** — paginated list of all posts from any IP hash across all boards
- **PoW CAPTCHA** — per-board opt-in SHA-256 proof-of-work for all posts (threads and replies); nonce replay blocked within the 5-minute validity window
- **Report system** — users can report posts; admins see an inbox with resolve and resolve+ban actions
- **Moderation log** — append-only audit trail of all admin actions, viewable from the panel
- Word filters (pattern → replacement, site-wide)
- **Full Site Backup & Restore** — entirely web-based, no shell access required; all operations stream from disk, never buffering the full backup in RAM
- **Scheduled VACUUM** — automatic database compaction on a configurable interval; reclaimed bytes logged
- **DB size warning** — admin panel shows a red banner when the database exceeds `db_warn_threshold_mb`
- **Expired poll cleanup** — background task purges stale vote rows on a configurable schedule
- Per-board controls: editing, edit window, archiving, video embeds, PoW CAPTCHA

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔒 Security
- **Argon2id** password hashing (`t=2, m=65536, p=2`)
- **Security headers** — CSP (`script-src 'self'`, no `unsafe-inline`), HSTS (1 year + subdomains), and Permissions-Policy on all responses
- **Inline JS eliminated** — all JavaScript extracted to external `.js` files; CSP fully enforced
- **CSRF** — double-submit cookie with constant-time token comparison (`subtle::ct_eq`)
- `HttpOnly` + `SameSite=Strict` session cookies with configurable `Secure` flag and `Max-Age`
- **Admin brute-force protection** — progressive lockout after 5 consecutive failed login attempts
- **PoW nonce replay prevention** — used nonces tracked in memory for the 5-minute validity window; stale entries auto-pruned
- Raw IPs **never stored or logged** — HMAC-keyed SHA-256 hash used everywhere
- Per-IP sliding-window rate limiting on POST endpoints (10/min) and page-load GET endpoints (60/min); `/api/` routes excluded from GET limiting
- **JPEG EXIF stripping + orientation correction** — GPS, device IDs, and all metadata removed; rotation normalized on upload
- All user input HTML-escaped before rendering; markup applied post-escape
- **Zip-bomb protection** — backup restore capped at 1 GiB per entry, 50,000 entries max
- **Backup upload size cap** — full and board restore endpoints reject uploads over 512 MiB
- **Redirect hardening** — backslash and encoded variants blocked on redirect parameters
- Path traversal prevention on all filesystem operations
- **Job queue back-pressure** — queue capped at `job_queue_capacity` entries; excess jobs dropped with a log warning, never causing OOM

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🗂️ Thread Lifecycle
- **Thread archiving** — overflow threads are archived (readable, locked, hidden from index) rather than deleted; configurable per board
- **Global `archive_before_prune` flag** — ensures no thread is silently hard-deleted on any archiving-enabled instance, even if the individual board didn't opt in
- **Archive page** — `/{board}/archive` with thumbnails, reply counts, and pagination
- **Thread auto-update** — delta-compressed polling keeps reply counts, lock/sticky badges, and new posts in sync without full reloads
- **ETag / Conditional GET** — board index and thread pages return `304 Not Modified` on cache hits; ETags included on all 200 responses
- **Response compression** — gzip, Brotli, or zstd negotiated automatically via `Accept-Encoding`
- **Floating new-reply pill** — "+N new replies ↓" notification; click to scroll, auto-dismisses after 30 seconds
- **"(You)" tracking** — posts you authored are marked with a `(You)` badge, persisted across refreshes
- Per-board toggle between archive-on-overflow and permanent deletion

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 📱 Mobile & UX
- **Mobile reply drawer** — floating action button slides up a full-width reply panel on small screens
- **Cross-board hover previews** — `>>>/board/123` links show a floating popup with client-side caching
- **Six built-in themes** — user-selectable via a floating picker; persisted in `localStorage` with no flash
- **Default theme** — `default_theme` in `settings.toml` sets the server-side default for new visitors; also configurable from the admin panel
- **Site subtitle** — `site_subtitle` in `settings.toml` customises the home page tagline at install time
- **Live stats** — total posts, uploads, and content size displayed on the home page
- **Background worker system** — video transcoding, waveform generation, and thread cleanup run asynchronously; duplicate media jobs coalesced; configurable ffmpeg timeout; exponential backoff on retries
- **Interactive keyboard console** — `[s]` stats · `[l]` boards · `[c]` create · `[d]` delete · `[q]` quit

## 🌐 ChanNet API

RustChan includes a two-layer federation and gateway system that runs automatically on **port 7070** alongside the main web server. No additional configuration is required to enable it — if you want to federate with another RustChan node or integrate with a RustWave client, just start talking to port 7070.

> **Text only.** No images, no media, and no binary data cross the ChanNet interface by design. All payloads are ZIP archives containing structured text (JSON manifests + plain `.txt` post bodies). Full schema documentation is in `channet_api_reference.docx`.

### Layer 1 — Node Federation

These endpoints let RustChan nodes sync content with each other. All responses are ZIP archives.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/chan/export` | `GET` | Export all posts from this node as a ZIP snapshot |
| `/chan/import` | `POST` | Import a ZIP snapshot from a remote node |
| `/chan/refresh` | `POST` | Pull fresh content from a known remote and apply it locally |
| `/chan/poll` | `GET` | Lightweight poll — returns only new content since a given timestamp |

**Quick example — pull content from a remote node:**

```bash
# Export your node's posts
curl http://localhost:7070/chan/export -o my-export.zip

# Import a ZIP from another node
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/chan/import \
     -H "Content-Type: application/zip" \
     --data-binary @remote-export.zip

# Refresh from a peer (supply the peer's export URL as the body)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/chan/refresh \
     -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
     -d "http://peer.example.com:7070/chan/export"

# Poll for posts newer than a Unix timestamp
curl "http://localhost:7070/chan/poll?since=1741900000" -o delta.zip
```

### Layer 2 — RustWave Gateway

The `/chan/command` endpoint exposes a typed JSON command interface for the [RustWave](https://github.com/a2kiti/rustwave) audio transport client. Send a JSON command, receive a ZIP back. `reply_push` is the only command that writes anything to the database.

```bash
# Full export via command interface
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/chan/command \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"command": "full_export"}' \
     -o full.zip

# Export a single board
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/chan/command \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"command": "board_export", "board": "b"}' \
     -o board-b.zip

# Export a single thread
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/chan/command \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"command": "thread_export", "board": "b", "thread_id": 42}' \
     -o thread-42.zip

# Export the archive for a board
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/chan/command \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"command": "archive_export", "board": "b"}' \
     -o archive.zip

# Force a refresh from a peer
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/chan/command \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"command": "force_refresh", "peer": "http://peer.example.com:7070"}' \
     -o result.zip

# Push a reply (the only write command)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/chan/command \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "command": "reply_push",
       "board": "b",
       "thread_id": 42,
       "body": "Hello from RustWave"
     }' \
     -o result.zip
```

### Firewall Note

Port 7070 is for node-to-node communication and RustWave integration. If you are running a public-facing instance and do not need federation, block port 7070 externally:

```bash
sudo ufw deny 7070/tcp
```

If you do want to federate with other nodes, allow port 7070 selectively rather than opening it to the world.

## 🔌 Optional Integrations: ffmpeg & Tor

RustChan is fully functional without either tool. When detected at startup, additional capabilities activate automatically.

### ffmpeg — Video & Audio Processing

When ffmpeg is available on `PATH`:

- **MP4 → WebM transcoding** (VP9 + Opus) for maximum browser compatibility
- **AV1 WebM → VP9 re-encoding** for browsers without AV1 support
- **Audio waveform thumbnails** via the `showwavespic` filter
- **Video thumbnail extraction** from the first frame for catalog previews

Without ffmpeg, videos are served in their original format and audio posts use a generic icon. Set `require_ffmpeg = true` in `settings.toml` to enforce its presence at startup. The ffmpeg execution timeout is configurable via `ffmpeg_timeout_secs` (default: 120).

See **[SETUP.md — Installing ffmpeg](SETUP.md#installing-ffmpeg)** for platform-specific instructions.

### Tor — Onion Service

RustChan includes **built-in Tor onion service support via [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti)** — no system `tor` installation required. Set `enable_tor_support = true` in `settings.toml` and restart. On first launch RustChan will:

1. Download ~2 MB of Tor directory data and bootstrap to the network (~30 seconds)
2. Generate a persistent Ed25519 keypair in `rustchan-data/arti_state/keys/`
3. Derive your permanent `.onion` address from that keypair and start the hidden service
4. Begin accepting and proxying inbound onion connections to the local HTTP port

The `.onion` address appears on the home page and in the admin panel as soon as the service is ready. Subsequent starts are ready in ~5 seconds using the cached consensus in `rustchan-data/arti_cache/`.

**Back up `rustchan-data/arti_state/keys/`** — this directory contains your service keypair. Losing it means a new `.onion` address on the next start. Delete it intentionally to rotate to a new address.

See **[SETUP.md — Tor](SETUP.md#tor--onion-service)** for details on key management and migrating from a previous system `tor` installation.

<br>

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Build
cargo build --release

# 2. Create an admin account
./rustchan-cli admin create-admin admin "YourStrongPassword!"

# 3. Create boards
./rustchan-cli admin create-board b    "Random"     "General discussion"
./rustchan-cli admin create-board tech "Technology" "Programming and hardware"

# 4. Start the server
./rustchan-cli
```

Open **`http://localhost:8080`** — the admin panel is at **`/admin`**.

On first launch, `rustchan-data/settings.toml` is generated with a fresh `cookie_secret` and all settings documented inline. Edit and restart to apply changes.

<br>

## 📁 Data Layout

All data lives in `rustchan-data/` alongside the binary. Nothing is written elsewhere unless explicitly overridden via environment variables.

## 💾 Backup & Restore

The entire backup system is accessible from the admin panel — no shell access required. All backup operations stream from disk in 64 KiB chunks; peak RAM overhead is roughly 64 KiB regardless of instance size. Backups are written to disk as temp files with an atomic rename on success, so partial backups never appear in the saved list.

### Full Site Backups

A full backup is a `.zip` containing a consistent SQLite snapshot (via `VACUUM INTO`) and all uploaded files.

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **💾 Save** | Creates a backup and writes it to `rustchan-data/full-backups/` |
| **⬇ Download** | Streams a saved backup to your browser |
| **↺ Restore (server)** | Restores from a file already on the server |
| **↺ Restore (upload)** | Restores from a `.zip` uploaded from your computer (max 512 MiB) |
| **✕ Delete** | Permanently removes the backup file |

### Per-Board Backups

Board backups are self-contained: a `board.json` manifest plus the board's upload directory. Other boards are never affected.

**Restore behaviour:**
- **Board exists** → content is wiped and replaced from the manifest
- **Board doesn't exist** → created from scratch
- All row IDs are **remapped** on import to prevent collisions

> Restore uses SQLite's `sqlite3_backup_init()` API internally — pages are copied directly into the live connection, so no file swapping, WAL deletion, or restart is needed.

<br>

## 🧰 Admin CLI

```bash
# Admin accounts
./rustchan-cli admin create-admin   <username> <password>
./rustchan-cli admin reset-password <username> <new-password>
./rustchan-cli admin list-admins

# Boards
./rustchan-cli admin create-board <short> <name> [description] [--nsfw]
./rustchan-cli admin delete-board <short>
./rustchan-cli admin list-boards

# Bans
./rustchan-cli admin ban       <ip_hash> "<reason>" [duration_hours]
./rustchan-cli admin unban     <ban_id>
./rustchan-cli admin list-bans
```

`<short>` is the board slug used in URLs (e.g. `tech` → `/tech/`). Lowercase alphanumeric, 1–8 characters.

<br>

## 🚀 Production Deployment

See **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** for a complete production guide covering:

- System user creation and hardened directory layout
- **systemd** service with security directives
- **nginx** reverse proxy with TLS via Let's Encrypt
- ffmpeg and Tor installation on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- First-run configuration walkthrough
- Raspberry Pi SD card wear reduction and blocking thread tuning
- Security hardening checklist

### Cross-Compilation

```bash
# ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 4/5)
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo install cross
cross build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Windows x86-64
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

The release profile enables `strip = true`, `lto = "thin"`, and `panic = "abort"`. Typical binary size: **12–18 MiB**.

<br>

## 🏗️ Architecture

RustChan is intentionally minimal — no template engine, no ORM, no JavaScript framework. HTML is rendered with plain Rust `format!` strings. The result is a single binary that starts in under a second.

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Web framework | [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) 0.8 |

## 🔐 Security Model

| Concern | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Passwords** | Argon2id (`t=2, m=65536, p=2`) — memory-hard, GPU-resistant |
| **Brute-force** | Progressive lockout after 5 failed admin login attempts per IP |
| **Sessions** | `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, `Max-Age` aligned to server config |
| **CSRF** | Double-submit cookie with constant-time token comparison (`subtle::ct_eq`) |
| **Security headers** | CSP (`script-src 'self'`, no `unsafe-inline`), HSTS (1 year + subdomains), Permissions-Policy |
| **Inline JavaScript** | Fully eliminated — all JS in external files; CSP enforced with no `unsafe-inline` |
| **IP privacy** | Raw IPs never stored or logged — HMAC-keyed SHA-256 hash used everywhere |
| **Rate limiting** | Sliding-window per hashed IP: POST endpoints (10/min), page-load GETs (60/min); `/api/` routes excluded |
| **Proxy support** | All handlers use proxy-aware IP extraction when `CHAN_BEHIND_PROXY=true` |
| **File safety** | Content-Type + magic byte validation; file extensions never trusted |
| **EXIF stripping** | All JPEG uploads re-encoded — GPS, device IDs, and all metadata discarded; EXIF orientation applied before strip |
| **XSS** | All user input HTML-escaped before rendering; markup applied post-escape |
| **Zip-bomb protection** | Backup restore capped at 1 GiB per entry, 50,000 entries max |
| **Backup upload cap** | Full and board restore endpoints reject uploads over 512 MiB |
| **Redirect hardening** | Backslash and percent-encoded variants blocked on `return_to` parameters |
| **Path traversal** | Backup filenames validated against `[a-zA-Z0-9._-]` before filesystem access |
| **Body limits** | Per-route limits on small endpoints (64 KiB) to prevent memory exhaustion |
| **Connection pool** | Configurable pool size; 5-second acquisition timeout; pool exhaustion returns 503 (not 500) |
| **PoW CAPTCHA** | SHA-256 hashcash (20-bit difficulty), verified server-side with 5-minute grace window; covers threads and replies |
| **PoW nonce replay** | Used nonces tracked in memory; stale entries auto-pruned after the validity window expires |
| **Job queue** | Capped at `job_queue_capacity`; excess jobs logged and dropped, never causing OOM |
| **Streaming uploads** | Multipart fields validated against size limits in flight; per-field text caps (~100 KB body, ~4 KB name/subject) prevent OOM from oversized forms |
| **Request timeout** | Middleware terminates slow or stalled client connections; guards against slowloris-style attacks |
| **Gateway IP safety** | ChanNet gateway posts carry no IP address; `ip_hash` is nullable throughout — `NULL` rendered as empty string, never causes a 500 |
| **Atomic config writes** | `settings.toml` written via temp-file-then-rename; config never partially written on crash |

## 🎨 Themes

Six built-in themes, selectable via the floating picker on every page. Persisted in `localStorage` with no flash on load. The site-wide default for new visitors is set via `default_theme` in `settings.toml` or from the admin panel.

| Theme | Description |
|---|---|
| **Terminal** *(default)* | Dark background, matrix-green monospace, glowing accents |
| **Frutiger Aero** | Frosted glass panels, pearl-blue gradients, rounded corners |
| **DORFic Aero** | Dark stone walls, torchlit amber/copper glass panels |
| **FluoroGrid** | Pale sage, muted teal grid lines, dusty lavender panels |
| **NeonCubicle** | Cool off-white, horizontal scanlines, steel-teal borders |
| **ChanClassic** | Light tan/beige background, maroon accents, blue post-number links — classic imageboard styling |

## 📋 Changelog

See **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** for the full version history.

**Latest — v1.1.0-alpha.2:**
**Tor migrated to Arti (built-in, no system `tor` required)** — Arti bootstraps in-process at startup, derives a `.onion` address from a persistent keypair in `arti_state/keys/`, and proxies onion connections to the local HTTP port; no subprocess, no `torrc`, no hostname file polling · Critical fix: ChanNet gateway posts have no IP — `ip_hash` changed to `Option<String>` throughout (no more 500s on pages with gateway posts) · Log files now written to `rustchan-data/` (not the binary directory) · Log file names fixed (`rustchan.2024-01-15.log` format) · Logs changed from dense JSON to human-readable text · Per-field multipart size caps (~100 KB body, ~4 KB name/subject) eliminate OOM risk from oversized form submissions · Poll duration overflow hardened · Backup system rewrites: `rusqlite::backup` API replaces fragile SQL string, RAII temp-file cleanup, pool exhaustion → 503 · DB pool size configurable; `r2d2::Error` correctly maps to 503 · All write transactions upgraded from DEFERRED to `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` · Rotating log files prevent disk exhaustion · 304 response builders fixed · Atomic `settings.toml` writes · Request timeout middleware (slowloris protection) · Worker `JoinHandle`s persisted; graceful shutdown via `CancellationToken` + bounded await · Job recovery on startup for interrupted jobs · ChanNet server graceful shutdown unified with main HTTP server · Background tasks use `tokio::select!` for clean cancellation
